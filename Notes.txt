Contains anything that should be written down for future reference.

#1 - To check for collision, maybe instead of searching if the pos of one object is overlapping that of the next object, I can write a system where the
    positions of certain objects are stored and dynamically updated (as needed, like asteroids that spawn and later despawn, during its lifetime needing
    to collide) and the main object (mostly just the player) can then go through all the pos values and if it does collide with one, it can pull up the obj.
    This seems faster then going through a bunch of objects and their positions.
